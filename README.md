Monopoly is a popular strategy board game for 2-6 players. Our goal is to recreate this classic board game experience in a convenient web application format as Monopoly Vancouver. Our board design will include popular Vancouver themed properties. Users will be able to play the game with friends without worrying about downloading large software packages on their computers. They will be able to create a profile, log in to the game and join a ‘game room’ with other players to play the game. The game itself will include all of the classic rules and mechanics including rolling dice, a currency system, buying properties, trading with other players, going to jail and much more. Once a player has lost all of their money and properties they are out of the game but can remain in the game room to spectate the rest of the game. Users will also be able to track the number of games they have played and the number of wins they have accumulated.
